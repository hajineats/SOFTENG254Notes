echo "$(date) $(cat /proc/meminfo | grep "MemFree" | tr -s " " | xargs echo)" >> memorylog.txt

1. cat /proc/meminfo will print out memory status
2. grep "MemFree" will return the lines that contain MemFree
3. tr -s " " will replace all the repeating, adjacent instances of the character " " with just a single blank
4. xargs echo will accept the stdin from the pipeline as its parameter
5. "$() $()" will concatenate the result of those two commands as one string
6. echo --- >> memorylog.txt will append the output of 'echo ---' to memorylog.txt as a new line
